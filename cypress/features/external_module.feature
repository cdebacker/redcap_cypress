Feature: Install EM

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that External Modules can be installed and enabled

  Scenario: Install External Module
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"

    # # {
    # When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
    # And I click on the link labeled exactly "Manage"
    # And I click on the button labeled "Enable a module"

    # And I click to enable the module named "REDCap CSS Injector" with version "v1.1.2"

    # Then I should see "This module uses the following hooks" in the dialog box
    
    # When I click on the button labeled "Enable" in the dialog box
    # }

    # Macro for above block
    # And I enable the External Module named "REDCap CSS Injector" with version "v1.1.2"
    # And I enable the External M

    # Test module specific features, such as a new control center link
    # Then I should see a link labeled "Test Module Dashboard"

    # Or just look to see that the module now appears in the list of enabled modules
    # Then I should see "REDCap CSS Injector - v1.1.2"


    # CSS Injector specific tests
